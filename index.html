            <p>I am a Security Software Engineer and have been working for BT since October 2015. I live in Cullybackey, Northern Ireland, UK with my wife Dannielle, my son Oliver and my 2 dogs and cat, Romeo, Ziva and Thor. I love coffee and playing video games, particularly my PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. My favourite video game franchise is Pokemon. My favourite movie franchise is Star Wars, closely followed by the MCU.</p></td>
